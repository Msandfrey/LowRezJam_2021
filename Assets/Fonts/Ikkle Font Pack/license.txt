Ikkle Font Pack brought you by: https://jackoatley.itch.io/ikkle-font-pack

All the fonts in this pack are 100% free to use. For distribution I'd ask you include a notice in the same folder, basically the name of the font and a link to the itch page of the font pack and a note saying "do not claim as your own". So, no obligation to include anything in the game itself, just that small note/txt file in the folder with the font(s). DM me on Twitter if you have further concerns: https://twitter.com/f_oatley :)
